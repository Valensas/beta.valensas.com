  - title: Payment and Electronic Money Institutions
    content: Payment systems and e-money institutions are regulated activities in Turkey (like many other jurisdictions). Such activities are subject to a great degree of scrutiny by the

      acquire a license. <br/>
      The package contains in-house developed native code libraries. The features are based on blockchain technology and capable of P2P money transfer.
